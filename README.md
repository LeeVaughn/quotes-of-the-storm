# Quotes of the Storm
This app generates random quotes from the characters and personalities surrounding the popular Heroes of the Storm video game developed by Blizzard Entertainment.

## Motivation
This project was originally created as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. I have since iterated and improved upon that initial application over time.

## Features
* Generates a random quote upon page load
* User can generate a new quote by clicking on the "New Quote" button
* User can click on the Twitter icon to tweet their favorite quotes along with the hashtags #QuotesOfTheStorm and #BlizzHeroes

## Future Improvements
* Add new quotes as new Heroes are released
* Register a custom domain for the app
* Improve layout design on various screen sizes

## Contributing
If you have any cool Heroes of the Storm related quotes you would like to see included you are welcome to add them to the quotesArray and submit a pull request. Alternatively, you can send the quote suggestion to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/DLVProgramming">@dlvprogramming</a>.
